# 🚨 URGENT: Netlify Deployment Issue

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**

The deployed site is still serving the old JavaScript file (`index-CVC1aS8X.js`) instead of our new one (`index-DQ-u3Bgn.js`). This is causing the 404 API errors.

## 🛠️ **Immediate Solutions:**

### **Option 1: Manual Netlify Redeploy (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Find your site: "ethiopian-community-resources"
3. Click on the site
4. Go to "Deploys" tab
5. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
6. Wait for deployment to complete
7. Test the site again

### **Option 2: Clear Netlify Cache**
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to your site
2. Go to "Site settings" → "Build & deploy"
3. Click "Clear cache and deploy site"
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### **Option 3: Force Cache Bust (Quick Fix)**
Add a cache-busting parameter to force reload:
1. Open: https://ethiopian-community-resources.netlify.app/?v=2
2. Or try: https://ethiopian-community-resources.netlify.app/?t=1234567890

## 🔍 **Verification Steps:**

After redeploying, check:
1. **HTML Source**: View page source and verify it shows `index-DQ-u3Bgn.js`
2. **Console**: Should show "Fetching programs with client-side API service"
3. **No 404 Errors**: API calls should work without 404 errors

## 📊 **Expected Results After Fix:**

✅ **Console Output:**
```
Fetching programs with client-side API service
Received programs: 2
Fetching stats with client-side API service
```

❌ **Current Console Output:**
```
Fetching programs from: https://ethiopian-community-resources.netlify.app/api/programs/search?
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
```

## 🎯 **Root Cause:**

The issue is that Netlify is serving cached files instead of the new deployment. This is a common issue with static site deployments.

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Manual redeploy** from Netlify dashboard (most reliable)
2. **Test the site** after redeployment
3. **Verify** the new JavaScript file is being served
4. **Confirm** no more 404 errors

The code changes are correct - it's just a deployment/caching issue that needs to be resolved manually.
